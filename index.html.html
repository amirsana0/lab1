<br>This article is about the sport. For the ball used in the sport, see

<br><b>Basketball</b> is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team_sport">team sport</a> in which two teams, most commonly of five players each, opposing one another on a rectangular <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball_court"> court </a>,  compete with the primary objective of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball#Shooting"> shooting </a> a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball_(ball)"> basketball </a> (approximately 9.4 inches (24 cm) in diameter) through the defender's hoop (a basket 18 inches (46 cm) in diameter mounted 10 feet (3.048 m) high to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backboard_(basketball)"> backboard </a>  at each end of the court) while preventing the opposing team from shooting through their own hoop. A field goal is worth two points, unless made from behind the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball_court#Three-point_line"> tree-point line </a> ,  when it is worth three. After a foul, timed play stops and the player fouled or designated to shoot a technical foul is given one, two or three one-point  <a  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_throw">free throws </a> .  The team with the most points at the end of the game wins, but if regulation play expires with the score tied, an additional period of play (overtime) is mandated.<br>
<br>Players advance the ball by bouncing it while walking or running (dribbling) or by passing it to a teammate, both of which require considerable skill. On offense, players may use a variety of shots – the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Layup"> layup </a>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jump_shot_(basketball)"> jump shot </a> , or a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slam_dunk"> dunk </a> ; on defense, they may steal the ball from a dribbler, intercept passes, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_(basketball)"> block </a> shots; either offense or defense may collect a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)"> rebound </a>, that is, a missed shot that bounces from rim or backboard. It is a violation to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traveling_(basketball)"> lift or dag one's pivot foot without dribbling the ball </a>, to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrying_(basketball)"> carry</a> it , or to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_dribble"> hold the ball with both hands then resume dribbling</a >.
<br>The five players on each side fall into five <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball_positions"> playing position</a>.The tallest player is usually the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_(basketball)"> center </a>,  the second-tallest and strongest is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_forward_(basketball)" > power forward </a>, a slightly shorter but more agile player is the<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_forward"> small forward </a>, and the shortest players or the best ball handlers are the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooting_guard"> shooting guard </a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_guard"> point guard </a>, who implements the coach's game plan by managing the execution of offensive and defensive plays (player positioning). Informally, players may play three-on-three, two-on-two, and one-on-one.

After rejecting other ideas as either too rough or poorly suited to walled-in<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gym">gymnasiums</a> , he invented a new game in which players  would pass a ball to teammates and try to score points by tossing the ball into a basket mounted on a wall. Naismith wrote the basic rules and nailed a peach basket onto an elevated track. Naismith initially set up the peach basket with its bottom intact, which meant that the ball had to be retrieved manually after each "basket" or point scored. This quickly proved tedious, so Naismith removed the bottom of the basket to allow the balls to be poked out with a long<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dowel">dowel</a> after each scored basket.
<br>Basketball was originally played with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ball_(association_football)">soccer ball</a>.These round balls from "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football">association football</a>" were made, at the time , with a set of laces to close off the hole needed for inserting the inflatable bladder after the other sewn-together segments of the ball's cover had been flipped outside-in.These laces could cause bounce passes and dribbling to be unpredictable.Eventually a lace-free ball construction method was invented, and this change to the game was endorsed by Naismith. (Whereas in<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football">American football</a>, the lace construction proved to be advantageous for gripping and remains to this day.) The first balls made specifically for basketball were brown, and it was only in the late 1950s that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Hinkle">Tony Hinkle</a>,  searching for a ball that would be more visible to players and spectators alike, introduced the orange ball that is now in common use. Dribbling was not part of the original game except for the "bounce pass" to teammates. Passing the ball was the primary means of ball movement. Dribbling was eventually introduced but limited by the asymmetric shape of early balls.Dribbling was common by 1896, with a rule against the double dribble by 1898.
<br>he peach baskets were used until 1906 when they were finally replaced by metal hoops with backboards. A further change was soon made, so the ball merely passed through. Whenever a person got the ball in the basket, his team would gain a point. Whichever team got the most points won the game.The baskets were originally nailed to the mezzanine balcony of the playing court, but this proved impractical when spectators in the balcony began to interfere with shots. The backboard was introduced to prevent this interference; it had the additional effect of allowing rebound shots.Naismith's handwritten diaries, discovered by his granddaughter in early 2006, indicate that he was nervous about the new game he had invented, which incorporated rules from a children's game called<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_on_a_rock">duck on a rock</a>, as many had failed before it.
<br>Frank Mahan, one of the players from the original first game, approached Naismith after the Christmas break, in early 1892, asking him what he intended to call his new game. Naismith replied that he hadn't thought of it because he had been focused on just getting the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game">game</a> started. Mahan suggested that it be called "Naismith ball", at which he laughed, saying that a name like that would kill any game. Mahan then said, "Why not call it basketball?" Naismith replied, "We have a basket and a ball, and it seems to me that would be a good name for it."The first official game was played in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YMCA_Building_(Albany,_New_York)">YMCA gymnasium in Albany</a>, New York, on January 20, 1892, with nine players. The game ended at 1–0; the shot was made from 25 feet (7.6 m), on a court just half the size of a present-day <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streetball">Street</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association">National Basketball Association</a> (NBA) court.
<br>At the time, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football">soccer</a> was being played with 10 to a team (which was increased to 11). When winter weather got too icy to play soccer, teams were taken indoors, and it was convenient to have them split in half and play basketball with five on each side. By 1897–1898 teams of five became standard.

<br>Basketball's early adherents were dispatched to YMCAs throughout the United States, and it quickly spread through the United States and Canada. By 1895, it was well established at several women's high schools. While YMCA was responsible for initially developing and spreading the game, within a decade it discouraged the new sport, as rough play and rowdy crowds began to detract from YMCA's primary mission. However, other amateur sports clubs, colleges, and professional clubs quickly filled the void. In the years before<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I">World War I</a>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amateur_Athletic_Union">Amateur Athletic Union</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Collegiate_Athletic_Association#History">Intercollegiate Athletic Association of the United States</a>vied for control over the rules for the game. The first pro league, the National Basketball League, was formed in 1898 to protect players from exploitation and to promote a less rough game. This league only lasted five years.
<br>James Naismith was instrumental in establishing college basketball. His colleague C.O. Beamis fielded the first college basketball team just a year after the Springfield YMCA game at the suburban Pittsburgh <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geneva_College">Geneva College</a>. Naismith himself later coached at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_Jayhawks_men%27s_basketball">University of Kansas </a> for six years, before handing the reins to renowned coach <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phog_Allen">Forrest "Phog" Allen</a>. Naismith's disciple <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amos_Alonzo_Stagg">Amos Alonzo Stagg</a> brought basketball to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Chicago">University of Chicago </a>, while <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolph_Rupp">Adolph Rupp</a>, a student of Naismith's at Kansas, enjoyed great success as coach at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky_Wildcats_men%27s_basketball">University of Kentucky</a>. On February 9, 1895, the first intercollegiate 5-on-5 game was played at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamline_University">Hamline University</a> between Hamline and the School of Agriculture, which was affiliated with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Minnesota">University of Minnesota</a>. The School of Agriculture won in a 9–3 game.
<br>In 1901, colleges, including the University of Chicago, Columbia University, Cornell University, Dartmouth College, the University of Minnesota, the U.S. Naval Academy, the University of Colorado and Yale University began sponsoring men's games. In 1905, frequent injuries on the football field prompted <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States">President</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_Roosevelt">Theodore Roosevelt</a> to suggest that colleges form a governing body, resulting in the creation of the Intercollegiate Athletic Association of the United States (IAAUS). In 1910, that body changed its name to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Collegiate_Athletic_Association">National Collegiate Athletic Association</a> (NCAA). The first Canadian interuniversity basketball game was played at YMCA in Kingston, Ontario on February 6, 1904, when McGill University – Naismith's alma mater – visited <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen%27s_University_at_Kingston">Queen's University</a>. McGill won 9–7 in overtime; the score was 7–7 at the end of regulation play, and a ten-minute overtime period settled the outcome. A good turnout of spectators watched the game.
<br>The first men's national championship tournament, the National Association of Intercollegiate Basketball tournament, which still exists as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Association_of_Intercollegiate_Athletics">National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics</a> (NAIA) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAIA_Men%27s_Basketball_Championships">tournament</a>, was organized in 1937. The first national championship for NCAA teams, the National Invitation Tournament (NIT) in New York, was organized in 1938; the NCAA national tournament began one year later. College basketball was rocked by gambling scandals from 1948 to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CCNY_point-shaving_scandal">1951</a>, when dozens of players from top teams were implicated in match fixing and point shaving. Partially spurred by an association with cheating, the NIT lost support to the NCAA tournament.

<br>Before widespread school district consolidation, most American high schools were far smaller than their present-day counterparts. During the first decades of the 20th century, basketball quickly became the ideal interscholastic sport due to its modest equipment and personnel requirements. In the days before widespread television coverage of professional and college sports, the popularity of high school basketball was unrivaled in many parts of America. Perhaps the most legendary of high school teams was Indiana's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin_Wonder_Five">Franklin Wonder Five</a>,  which took the nation by storm during the 1920s, dominating Indiana basketball and earning national recognition.
<br>Today virtually every high school in the United States fields a basketball team in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varsity_team">varsity</a> competition.Basketball's popularity remains high, both in rural areas where they carry the identification of the entire community, as well as at some larger schools known for their basketball teams where many players go on to participate at higher levels of competition after graduation. In the 2016–17 season, 980,673 boys and girls represented their schools in interscholastic basketball competition, according to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Federation_of_State_High_School_Associations">National of State High School Associations</a>.The states of Illinois,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana">Indiana</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky">Kentucky</a> re particularly well known for their residents' devotion to high school basketball, commonly called Hoosier Hysteria in Indiana; the critically acclaimed film <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoosiers_(film)">Hoosiers</a> shows high school basketball's depth of meaning to these communities.
<br>There is currently no tournament to determine a national high school champion. The most serious effort was the National Interscholastic Basketball Tournament at the University of Chicago from 1917 to 1930. The event was organized by<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amos_Alonzo_Stagg">Amos Alonzo Stagg</a> and sent invitations to state champion teams. The tournament started out as a mostly Midwest affair but grew. In 1929 it had 29 state champions. Faced with opposition from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Federation_of_State_High_School_Associations">National Federation of State High School Associations</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Central_Association_of_Colleges_and_Schools">North Central Association of Colleges and Schoolls</a>  that bore a threat of the schools losing their accreditation the last tournament was in 1930. The organizations said they were concerned that the tournament was being used to recruit professional players from the prep ranks.The tournament did not invite minority schools or private/parochial schools.
<br>The National Catholic Interscholastic Basketball Tournament ran from 1924 to 1941 at Loyola University.he National Catholic Invitational Basketball Tournament from 1954 to 1978 played at a series of venues, including Catholic University, Georgetown and George Mason. The National Interscholastic Basketball Tournament for Black High Schools was held from 1929 to 1942 at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hampton_University">Hampton University</a>.The National Invitational Interscholastic Basketball Tournament was held from 1941 to 1967 starting out at Tuskegee Institute. Following a pause during World War II it resumed at Tennessee State College in Nashville. The basis for the champion dwindled after 1954 when Brown v. Board of Education began an integration of schools. The last tournaments were held at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama_State_University">Alabama State College</a> from 1964 to 1967.
<br><b>Profession basketball</b>
<br>Teams abounded throughout the 1920s. There were hundreds of men's professional basketball teams in towns and cities all over the United States, and little organization of the professional game. Players jumped from team to team and teams played in armories and smoky dance halls. Leagues came and went. Barnstorming squads such as the Original Celtics and two all-African American teams, the New York Renaissance Five ("Rens") and the (still existing) Harlem Globetrotters played up to two hundred games a year on their national tours.
<br>In 1946, the Basketball Association of America (BAA) was formed. The first game was played in Toronto, Ontario, Canada between the Toronto Huskies and New York Knickerbockers on November 1, 1946. Three seasons later, in 1949, the BAA merged with the National Basketball League (NBL) to form the National Basketball Association (NBA). By the 1950s, basketball had become a major college sport, thus paving the way for a growth of interest in professional basketball. In 1959, a basketball hall of fame was founded in Springfield, Massachusetts, site of the first game. Its rosters include the names of great players, coaches, referees and people who have contributed significantly to the development of the game. The hall of fame has people who have accomplished many goals in their career in basketball. An upstart organization, the American Basketball Association, emerged in 1967 and briefly threatened the NBA's dominance until the ABA-NBA merger in 1976. Today the NBA is the top professional basketball league in the world in terms of popularity, salaries, talent, and level of competition.
<br>The NBA has featured many famous players, including George Mikan, the first dominating "big man"; ball-handling wizard Bob Cousy and defensive genius Bill Russell of the Boston Celtics; charismatic center Wilt Chamberlain, who originally played for the barnstorming Harlem Globetrotters; all-around stars Oscar Robertson and Jerry West; more recent big men Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Shaquille O'Neal, Hakeem Olajuwon and Karl Malone; playmakers John Stockton, Isiah Thomas and Steve Nash; crowd-pleasing forwards Julius Erving and Charles Barkley; European stars Dirk Nowitzki, Pau Gasol and Tony Parker; more recent superstars LeBron James, Allen Iverson, Kobe Bryant, and Stephen Curry; and the three players who many credit with ushering the professional game to its highest level of popularity during the 1980s and 1990s: Larry Bird, Earvin "Magic" Johnson, and Michael Jordan.

In 2001, the NBA formed a developmental league, the National Basketball Development League (later known as the NBA D-League and then the NBA G League after a branding deal with Gatorade). As of the 2018–19 season, the G League has 27 teams.
